# Spirograph-html-
This tool is perfect for anyone fascinated by generative art, mathematical beauty, or interactive design. It offers a captivating way to explore creativity while understanding the underlying math behind spirographs.

This project is an interactive Spirograph Visualizer, blending mathematics, art, and interactivity in a single HTML/CSS/JavaScript page. It features a dynamic canvas that generates mesmerizing spirograph patterns in real-time, with user controls to customize and explore infinite variations.
Features:

    Dynamic Controls:
        Sliders to adjust:
            Speed: Control the animation speed.
            Radius: Change the size of the pattern.
            Steps: Define the resolution and complexity of the shape.
        Buttons:
            Randomize Colors: Instantly change the color palette for vibrant new designs.
            Randomize Shapes: Generate entirely new shapes by altering frequencies and amplitudes in the mathematical formulas.

    Interactive Mouse Input:
        The mouse position directly influences the pattern, creating a unique, immersive experience where the shapes respond dynamically to user movement.

    Artistic and Mathematical Fusion:
        Patterns are generated using trigonometric functions (sin, cos), producing complex and hypnotic geometrical designs.
        The use of randomization ensures infinite possibilities, with each click and slider adjustment leading to a fresh creation.

    Aesthetic Design:
        A sleek user interface with modern controls.
        The canvas is styled with glowing effects and vibrant gradients, enhancing the visual appeal.

How It Works:

    The spirograph is built by iterating over a series of angles, calculating points using sinusoidal equations. Additional parameters like frequency and amplitude dynamically alter the shape.
    User interaction (sliders, buttons, mouse) adjusts these parameters in real-time, allowing for endless customization.
